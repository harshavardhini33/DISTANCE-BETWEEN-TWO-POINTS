# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
 Import math function.
### Step 2: 
Assign the values of point 1 and point 2 whose distance is to be calculated.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: 
Print the coding to get the answer.
### Step 5: 
End the program

import numpy as np
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
dist=np.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(dist))
